EXERCISE 05: gitignore

Turn-in directory:      ex05/
Files to turn in:       git_ignore.sh
Allowed functions:      None

â€¢ In this exercice, you will write a short shell script that lists all the existing files
ignored by your GiT repository. Example:
%> bash git_ignore.sh | cat -e
.DS_Store$
mywork.c$
%>
To test your script, we will use our own environment

HINT: RTFM!
